# Things we want to ignore.
# Why ignore these things?
#
# - Maybe you want to use a different Node version
# - Maybe you prefer different editor settings
# - You should always install dependencies yourself - this also cuts down on repo size
# - ...and other good reasons...

##
# Do not enforce a Node version
##
.nvmrc

##
# Ignore node_modules/ folder
# Install your own deps
##
node_modules/
src/public/vendor/

##
# Ignore any large files or data that should
# be kept separate on individual machines
